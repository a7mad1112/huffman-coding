# Huffman Coding and Min Heap Implementation

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for a simple yet effective demonstration of Huffman Coding implemented using a Min Heap. This project showcases the power of data compression techniques in a user-friendly web interface.

## Features
- Huffman Coding Algorithm: Efficiently compresses data using variable-length codes.
- Min Heap Data Structure: Optimizes the Huffman coding process for faster encoding and decoding.
- Interactive Web Interface: Allows users to visually understand and interact with the Huffman coding process.
- Source Code: Well-documented source code for learning and modification.

## How to Use
1. Visit the Website: Open the provided URL to access the web interface.
2. Input Data: Enter the text you wish to compress.
3. View Results: Observe the Huffman Tree, encoded data, and compression statistics.

## Installation (For Local Setup)
1. Clone Repository: git clone https://github.com/a7mad1112/huffman-coding.git
2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run npm install (assuming Node.js is installed).
3. Run the Application: Execute npm start to launch the web server and access the application locally

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data Structures: Implementation of Min Heap and Huffman Coding in JS.
